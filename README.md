# TouchpadKeypad
Use touchpad as a keypad for osu!

If your going to use this to play osu! you might find that the low polling rates often found on touchpads (mine is 84hz) causes low accuracy. Laptops which use an interface other than PS/2 probably poll higher and can be increased.

## Requirements
Precision touch driver (you can usually install this if your laptop didn't come with it).

## Usage
When you first run the app make sure to calibrate it by tapping all edges of the touchpad. This will be saved to the registry (Software\TouchpadKeypad) and loaded next time.

## TODO
* Disable the touchpad movement so the touchpad doesnt jump all over the screen. Tablet is still useable since it overrides touchpad inputs
