# TouchpadKeypad
Use touchpad as a keypad for osu!

## Requirements
Precision touch driver (you can usually install this if your laptop didn't come with it)

## TODO
* Instead of splitting the touchpad into two parts use a better method for detecting each finger so it works on all touchpads (currently the center is set to that of my laptop)
* Disable the touchpad movement so the touchpad doesnt jump all over the screen. Tablet is still useable since it overrides touchpad inputs
